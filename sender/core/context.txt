A Job is the user's request to remind something.

A prompt is of four types:
SIMPLE: This is normal conversation between user and LLM. This doesn't involve seeking for already scheduled jobs, or creating/deleting/updating jobs.
SEEK: A user is asking about already scheduled job. It could be either deleting it, or updating it.
CREATE: A user is asking to create a job. A job is a reminder for later, could be once or cron.
INVALID: Anything that is not SIMPLE, SEEK, CREATE is INVALID
